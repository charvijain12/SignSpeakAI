# SignSpeakAI - Gesture Recognition using ASL 👐

## Introduction 🚀

Gesture Recognition using ASL (American Sign Language) is a project designed for recognizing hand gestures and interpreting them as letters from the American Sign Language alphabet. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), this application aims to bridge communication gaps for individuals who use sign language.

## Key Features 🌟

- **CNN Model:** Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network for accurate gesture recognition 🧠
- **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained on a sign language dataset and evaluated for accuracy 📈
- **Visualization:** Confusion matrix and classification report provide insights into the model's performance 📊
- **User Interaction:** Enables users to interact with the system through gestures 🤖
